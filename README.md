# Belvedere WebGIS

Code for the Django-based WebGIS for the Belvedere Glacier monitoring project. The development of this platform is part of the students capacity building initiative of the Belvedere Glacier Summer School yearly organised by the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering of Politecnico di Milan (Italy).


![Overview of the Belvedere Glacier WebGIS platform](assets/belvedere-webgis-overview.png)

The platform aims at becoming an operational tool for the exploration and visualisation of the in situ campaign for the collection of GNSS measurements of targets as well as for orthophotos and digital surface models resulting from the photogrammetric processing of drone images.

Built on top of free and open source technologies, the project was possible thanks to the adoption of the following libraries and tools:

* [**PostgreSQL**](https://www.postgresql.org/) + [**PostGIS**](https://postgis.net/)
* [**Django**](https://github.com/django/django)
* [**Cesium JS**](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium)
* [**Plotly.js**](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js)
* [**jsPDF**](https://github.com/parallax/jsPDF)
